# Spotify-Playlist-To-MusicVid
A Miscellaneous tool I created that, given a Spotify playlist, will play the songs in the playlist in a queue as music videos. Simple project to satisfy my random urges. 

Features: 
- Allows you to shuffle the songs 
- Allows you to skip through music videos 
- Plays Videos using Pafy on your PC itself 
- Local Storage (You won't need to constantly wait for a playlist of 800 songs to be grabbed everytime, pull the songs within milliseconds from a locally created DB) 

What's Next: 
- Going to connect to online DB storage to allow cross device access for the same playlist in seconds
